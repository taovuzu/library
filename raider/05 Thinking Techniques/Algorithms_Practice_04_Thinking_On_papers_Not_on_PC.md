### **Thinking – On Paper, Not on the PC**  

Remember the **comfort zone**? As you progress from **easy** to **medium** to **hard** problems, you will struggle more.  
The more complex the problem, the **more thinking** it requires before implementation.  

One of the biggest mistakes coders make is their love for the **PC**—they jump into coding immediately.  
- This often leads to writing a solution without taking necessary steps (e.g., verifying the idea and order).  
- The mind gets **trapped** inside the code, leading to constant *workarounds* instead of proper problem-solving.  

### **Think on Paper First**  
It is **far better** to think on **paper**, away from the PC.  
- **Sketch** the **full idea** and verify its correctness before coding.  
- The same applies when implementing a **hard problem**—plan the code before typing it.  

Your **instinct** might say:  
> *"Coding directly on the PC is faster!"*  

Tell yourself:  
> *"No, this is not an easy problem. I need to plan first."*  

If you sketch an idea or code on paper and later **find a mistake**, **step away from the PC!**  
- Go back to paper and **restart your thinking process**.  
- **Never** try to fix major logic issues directly on the PC—it will only waste time.  

### **In Real ICPC Contests**  
- **Teams consist of 3 people, but only 1 PC!**  
- If you develop the habit of **thinking on paper**, you will save **valuable team time** during the contest.
