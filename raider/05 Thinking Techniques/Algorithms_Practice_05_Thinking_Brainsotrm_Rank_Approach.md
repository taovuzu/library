### **Thinking – Brainstorming, Ranking, and Approaching**  

Many times, contestants start thinking about a problem, find an idea (e.g., *"Let’s solve it using DP"*), and immediately **dive into it** without proper evaluation.  

**What does "Diving" mean?**  
- Jumping straight into solving a problem based on an idea.  
- Spending **too much time** without making real progress.  
- Getting **stuck in thinking** without a clear direction.  

**Why does this happen?**  
- The **idea might be correct**, but the contestant lacks knowledge of related algorithms to continue.  
- The **idea might be correct**, but insufficient observations were made.  
- The **approach might be correct** (e.g., using DP), but the **specific recurrence is wrong** and needs adjustment.  
- The **approach itself might be incorrect**, requiring a completely different way of thinking.

### **How to Avoid Getting Stuck?**  

Before committing to a single approach, **brainstorm** multiple possible solutions.  
For example:  
- If asked to **find the minimum X**, consider different approaches:  
  **DP, Greedy, Min Cut, Branch & Bound, or some ad-hoc technique** might work.  

**Steps to systematically approach a problem:**  

1️⃣ **Rank Your Guesses**  
   - List all possible approaches and analyze their feasibility.  
   - Rank them based on how promising they seem.  

2️⃣ **Choose the Most Probable Approach**  
   - Start solving the problem with the highest-ranked idea (even if it turns out to be wrong).  

3️⃣ **Keep Track of Time**  
   - Monitor the time you spend on a particular approach.  
   - Ask yourself: *"At what point did I start solving it this way?"*  

4️⃣ **Reevaluate Your Ranking**  
   - After a brief analysis, reassess your approach.  
   - Is your current method still the best?  
   - If not, switch to another ranked idea.

### **No Idea is a Bad Idea!**  
Even if an idea seems **ridiculous or unlikely to work**, **give it a try!**  
- In many **hard DP problems**, a state might seem **too large** to handle.  
- But then, with the right **observation**, a **sparse space optimization** could make it feasible.  
- What seemed impossible **suddenly becomes solvable!**  

By following this structured approach, you **increase efficiency**, avoid getting stuck, and improve problem-solving skills. 🚀
