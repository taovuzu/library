## 1. Introduction: Classifying Problems

### **Difficulty Levels**
- **Basic, Medium, Hard:**  
  Problems can be classified by their difficulty.  
  - **Basic:** Often solved with direct simulation or simple manipulation.
  - **Medium:** May require abstraction, proper selection of algorithms, or a combination of data structures.
  - **Hard:** Often assembled from multiple aspects—sometimes involving deep analysis, innovative observations, or tricky calculations.

### **Problem Categories**
1. **Ad-hoc Problems:**  
   - Direct but may require creative observations.
2. **Data Structure Problems:**  
   - Involves structures like Trie, Heaps, Disjoint-Set, BIT (Fenwick Tree), Segment Tree, Balanced Trees, etc.
3. **Algorithm Problems:**  
   - **Search Algorithms:**  
     - Examples: Brute Force, Binary/Ternary Search, Golden Section Search, Backtracking, DFS/BFS, Meet-in-the-Middle.
   - **Optimization Algorithms:**  
     - Examples: Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Branch and Bound, Divide and Conquer.
   - **Sub-field Algorithms:**  
     - Covering Graph Theory, Computational Geometry, Game Theory, String Matching, etc.

*Observation:*  
- An easy ad-hoc problem might only involve basic array manipulation.
- A hard ad-hoc problem might need careful observation to extract key properties.
- For algorithmic problems, success often depends on the correct abstraction and proper selection of the algorithm.

## 2. FCI CU Training Model

The training at FCI (Faculty of Computers & Information, Cairo University) evolved into a permanent, systematic practice program. It is divided into several phases:

### **Phase 1: Knowledge Phase**
- **Focus:**  
  - Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.
  - Learning new algorithms every year.
- **Practice:**  
  - Solve problems immediately after learning each algorithm.
  - Emphasis on mastering easy and medium problems.
- **Importance:**  
  - A team that does not master algorithms is unlikely to succeed in regional or ICPC World Finals.

### **Phase 2: Marathon Phase**
- **Long Contests:**  
  - Involves contests such as TJU, SPOJ marathons, DP marathons, and World Final marathons.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Sustained problem solving to enhance speed and endurance.

### **Phase 3: International Fegla Home Local Contest**
- **Individual Training Phase:**  
  - Focus on ACM-style contests.
  - Performance measured by speed, first correct submission, and total problems solved.
  - Helps in identifying individual strengths and weaknesses.
- **Team Training Phase:**  
  - Practice as a team to develop strategies, communication, and coordinated problem solving.
  - Teams practice contest strategies, which can vary among teams or contest levels (regional vs. World Finals).

*Final Outcome:*  
- By the end of this training, participants are exposed to a wide range of problems from various ACM ICPC regional contests.

## 3. Criticism and Observations

### **Performance in Regional Contests**
- **Top Teams:**  
  - On average, top teams solve about 7 out of 10 problems.
- **Issues Observed:**  
  - Fatal mistakes may occur because there is little practice on unsolved or tough problems.
  - In marathon sessions for unsolved problems, typically only a few individuals manage to crack them.
- **Thinking Skills:**  
  - There is often a lack of focused training on pure “thinking skills” or the mental process needed to extract key observations from problems.
  - A recurring pattern is fast pattern recognition on familiar ideas, but difficulty when fresh, deep analysis is required.

### **Team vs. Individual Performance**
- **In Regional Contests:**  
  - Teams may perform well overall, yet individuals might struggle under the contest’s pressure, especially during onsite rounds.
  
*Key Insight:*  
- Enhancing analytical thinking and pure problem-solving skills remains a critical challenge.

## 4. Proposed Training Plan

The author proposes a revised training plan based on over 6 years of experience:

### **Focus Areas**
1. **Enhancing Thinking Skills:**  
   - Training should explicitly target the development of mental processing and analysis skills.
2. **Ad-hoc Problem Practice:**  
   - Fresh students should concentrate on solving ad-hoc problems that require creative thinking.
   - Coaches are encouraged to select a wide range of ad-hoc problems ordered by their level of difficulty and required insight.

3. **Coding & Debugging Skills**
   - **Language Mastery:**  
     - Deep familiarity with the chosen programming language, data types, and internal algorithms.
   - **Debugging:**  
     - Regular practice in identifying and fixing errors is essential.

4. **Gradual Introduction to Algorithms**
   - **Step-by-Step Approach:**  
     - Start with search and optimization techniques.
     - Later, introduce basic data structures and algorithms in various fields (e.g., Trie, Graph algorithms).
   - **Learning Method:**  
     - First, gain an intuitive understanding of the algorithm.
     - Practice with basic problems before delving into theoretical proofs and more complex problems.
     - Use recommended textbooks such as *Introduction to Algorithms* or *Algorithms* by Cormen et al., and solve related exercises.

5. **Mathematics:**  
   - Engage with mathematical texts (e.g., *Concrete Mathematics*) to broaden analytical skills.

## 5. Principles to Apply During Training

Here are several principles the author recommends to maximize improvement:

1. **Never Just Memorize:**
   - Always aim to understand the algorithm and the underlying logic deeply.

2. **Avoid Relying on Pre-made Libraries:**
   - Write algorithms from scratch rather than copying code from a library. This reinforces memory and understanding.

3. **Maintain a Clear Vision:**
   - Have a specific training goal for each session (e.g., improving reading speed, refining coding techniques, or boosting debugging skills).

4. **Manage Stress Effectively:**
   - In contests, stress can lead to mistakes. In training, focus on accuracy first—speed will come with time.

5. **Simulate Contest Conditions:**
   - Practice as if in a real contest. This includes time management and decision-making under pressure.

6. **Embrace the Challenge Spirit:**
   - Aim high and be willing to tackle difficult problems. Challenging yourself is key to reaching top competitive levels.

7. **Diversify Training Sources:**
   - Use problems from different online judges (e.g., TopCoder, UVA, IOI) to avoid style bias and broaden problem-solving experience.

8. **Self-Monitoring:**
   - Regularly evaluate your strategies in reading, thinking, coding, and debugging. Revise and update your training plan as needed.

9. **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):**
   - Focus your training on problems that are slightly beyond your current abilities (not too easy and not impossibly hard).

10. **Avoid Chaotic, Random Practice:**
    - A systematic approach is crucial. Random practice leads to inconsistent progress.  
    - Instead, work on refining your optimal problem-solving path step by step.

11. **Develop Discipline:**
    - Systematic practice is essential. Even if your mind tends to work in chaos, structure your training to gradually build optimal problem-solving techniques.

12. **Work Smart, Not Just Hard:**
    - Efficiency in training matters more than simply increasing hours. Find smarter ways to practice that maximize your improvement.
